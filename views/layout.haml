/ put your js at the end of your code, because you don't really need it in the first seconds.

/RESTFUL routing:

/Users
/users index GET
/users//  show GET
/users/new new GET
/users/new create GET
/users/1/edit edit GET
/users/1/edit update POST
/users/1/destroy destroy DELETE



/create read update and destroy: CRUD

/So, for example in the relationship between User and Posts tables in routes:
/users/:user_id/posts   index GET
/users/:user_id/posts/:id show GET
/users/:user_id/posts/new new GET
/users/:user_id/posts/new create POST
/users/:user_id/posts/:id/update POST
